# Water Flow Grid Analysis

This project is designed to analyze and display grid-based data showing water flow potential from two different ocean sources on a grid map. It utilizes a React frontend to display grids and an Express backend to handle data retrieval and processing from Google Sheets.

## Features

- Fetch grid setups from Google Sheets.
- Display grids with color-coded cells based on water reachability from two ocean points (NW and SE).
- Interactive grid selection from fetched Google Sheets tabs.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js (v18.x or higher recommended)
- npm (v6.x or higher)

## Installation

- Go to /server and '''run yarn''' and '''yarn dev''' to run the server.
- Go to /frontend and '''run yarn''' and '''yarn start''' to run the frontend app.
