Task Definition: Island Water Flow Analysis

Objective: Develop a system to determine the number of grid cells in various topographical scenarios of an island where water can flow down to both the island's northwest and southeast edges. This information is presented in a grid format within a Google Sheet.

Task Requirements:

Data Retrieval: Access a Google Sheet that contains multiple tabs, each representing a different grid setup of the island's terrain. The Google Sheet must be read in the real time during the code execution. Each cell in the grid represents the elevation at that geographic point. The northwest and southeast edges of the grid are adjacent to two different oceans.

Algorithm Challenge: Implement an algorithm to identify the cells from which water can flow to both oceans. Water can flow from a higher or equal height cell to an adjacent lower or equal height cell. Your task is to calculate the number of such cells that have a direct or indirect flow path to both the northwest and southeast edges.

Output: Create a web application where users can select a scenario (a tab from the Google Sheet) and view the number of qualifying cells and their coordinates. These results should dynamically update based on the user's selection.

Test and Validation: Conduct a complete screen recording from the start to the end of the development process. This recording should include:

A walkthrough of your coding and problem-solving process.
Execution of the solution using all provided test cases in the spreadsheet.
Clear display of the results for each test case within the application.
Submission: Upload the continuous screen recording and a folder containing all your code/solution files to the following link: Submission Link

Instructions for the Candidate:

You may select any programming language, framework, or library that you are comfortable with to complete this task.
Your entire coding session, including all aspects of development and testing, must be screen recorded continuously. Feel free to add voice annotations as you work, "thinking out loud" as if you were sitting next to a colleague and walking them through how you work.
